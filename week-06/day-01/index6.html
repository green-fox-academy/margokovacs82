                    texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

                <p> It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful

                    line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>

                <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and
                    devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control
